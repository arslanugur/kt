// Kotlin is a modern programming language that is concise, safe, pragmatic, and focused on interoperability with Java code.
// It can be used almost everywhere Java is used today: for server-side development, Android apps, and much more.

fun main(args : Array<String>) {
    println("Hello, World!")        //  goodbye System.out.;))
} 

// The main function is the entry point of every Kotlin program.
// The println() function is used to output the text that is provided between its parentheses. 
// For now, just remember that the println() function is used to output text.

// println() is function which prints a text and leave a line.
// If you want to print something in console without leaveing a line you can use print() function
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("I will leave line")
    println("Me too")
    
    print("I will not leave line")
    print("I am in one line because no line is changed")
}       // Semicolon at the end of a statement is optional in Kotlin, whereas it is mandatory in Java

/*
Output:
I will leave line
Me too
I will not leave lineI am in one line because no line is changed
