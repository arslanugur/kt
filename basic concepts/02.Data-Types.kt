// Each value in Kotlin must have a type.
// Some of the most used built-in data types are:
          // Int indicates an integer (whole number),             such as 42.
          // Double and Float are used to store decimal numbers,  such as 12.4.
          // Char represents a character,                         such as 'z'.
          // Boolean has two possible values, either true or false. 

// https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-types.html

// The text for a String is enclosed in double quotes.
// The \n character can be used in a string to create a line break, for example:
fun main(args : Array<String>) {
    println("A \nB \nC") 
} 

/*
Output:
A 
B 
C
*/

// \n for line break \t for tab space
